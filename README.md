# Automatic-Modulation-Classification-under-Phase-Imperfections
We implement CNN-based Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) by applying a polar transformation to the received symbols along with a modification to the kernel dimensions of the CNN in order to improve the performance of the classification procedure under phase imperfections.
